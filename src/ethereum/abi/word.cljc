(ns ethereum.abi.word
  "32-byte ABI words, on two runtimes that cannot hold one.

  This is the one file in this library that knows which runtime it is on —
  the same containment `blake2.word` and `storj.node.bytes` use. Everything
  above it is a single code path.

  A `uint256` is 256 bits. The JVM's widest primitive is 64 and JavaScript's
  `Number` stops being exact at 53, so integers travel through this library
  as **decimal strings**, and the platform's arbitrary-precision integer
  (`BigInteger`, `BigInt`) appears only in the block below.

  Signed values are **two's complement over the full 256-bit word**: -1 is
  thirty-two `0xff` bytes. That is what distinguishes this from a
  sign-magnitude encoding like Filecoin's `big.Int`, where -1 is two bytes.
  The two are easy to confuse and are wrong in both directions."

;; ── the platform block ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
;; Bounds are built from hex rather than by shifting, because a shift is
;; spelled differently on each side and gets truncated to 32 bits on one of
;; them if written the obvious way.
;;
;; One reader conditional per definition, not one `(do …)` around all of
;; them. nbb does not make vars defined inside a top-level `do` visible to
;; the top-level forms that follow when a namespace is *required* — it works
;; when the same file is run as a script, which is how the shape survives a
;; first test. `blake2.word` gets away with a `do` only because everything
;; that uses it lives inside the same block.
